Name of Project: Stock Data Analysis

Project Overview: This project was designed to analyze the S&P 500 and to identify the information that can be gathered by breaking the index into its components.  

Elliot�s html page: This tab illustrates historical index stock performance over the past 4.8 years. 

Julie�s html page: Breaks the index into various components to see what information could be gathered about the S&P 500. 

* The 2018 Market Cap tab: The S&P 500 is a value weighted index. This means that the index�s performance is skewed by companies with larger market capitalizations. Through visualization, the user can see which stocks and sectors have a greater impact on the performance of the S&P 500.
* The market cap by sector tab: This tab illustrates how the index is allocated among industry sectors. Users can see which sectors have a greater impact on the performance of the S&P 500.
* The Market Cap 2013 vs 2018: This tab illustrates which sectors and companies have generated positive and negative return between 2013 to 2018. Users can hover over bubbles to learn more about each company and its respective performance.
* The 2013 to 2018 Winners and Losers tab: This tab illustrates company and industry performance using a line chart. Users can easily identify which companies have performed extremely well or extremely poorly over the past 4.8 years.
* The asset by location tab: This tab illustrates where each company is headquartered. It also shows the size of the company and which cities are more dependent on certain industry sectors.

Nick�s tab:

Rose�s tab: Through the use of filters, the user can screen by sector to see which combinations have larger market capitalization. The user can learn more about the stock by hovering over the dots.

Configuration instructions:

The team pulled market data into a csv file from Capital IQ. The csv file was uploaded into MongoDB and converted to tables using Python. We then used D3 to create charts and presented the charts using HTML. Visualizations are best viewed using Microsoft Edge (Visualizations cannot be viewed using Chrome).

Credits and acknowledgements:
When creating this page, we used charts based on Jim Vallandingham�s work Organization and style inspired by: https://bost.ocks.org/mike/chart. Additionally, we used code inspired from examples on https://d3js.org/
